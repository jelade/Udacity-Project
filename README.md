# Investigate Medical Appointments in Brazil


## Introduction
This project investigates a dataset containing information from 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil. The primary focus is to determine whether patients show up for their appointments and understand the factors that influence their attendance.

### Dataset Description
The dataset includes several key attributes:
- **ScheduledDay:** The date when the patient set up their appointment.
- **Neighborhood:** The location of the hospital.
- **Scholarship:** Indicates if the patient is enrolled in the Brazilian welfare program Bolsa Fam√≠lia.
- **No-show:** Indicates if the patient did not show up for their appointment ('No' if they showed up, 'Yes' if they did not).

### Research Questions
1. What factors are important to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
2. What impact does the number of days between scheduling and the appointment date have on showing up for medical appointments?


## Findings
1. **Overall Attendance:** The majority of patients, 79.8%, show up for their appointments. Patients aged 40 years and above are more likely to attend their appointments compared to younger patients, who might miss appointments due to busier schedules.
2. **Scholarships and SMS Notifications:** Patients without scholarships and those who did not receive SMS reminders tend to show up for their appointments more frequently than those with scholarships and those who received SMS reminders.
3. **Health Conditions and Appointment Timing:** Patients with illnesses like hypertension, diabetes, and handicaps have a higher proportion of showing up for their appointments. Appointments on Saturdays and Wednesdays have higher attendance rates, while Mondays have the lowest. Additionally, patients with more than 20 days between scheduling and the appointment date tend to miss their appointments.

## Conclusions
Summary of findings and insights derived from the analysis. This section addresses the research questions and provides actionable recommendations based on the data.
